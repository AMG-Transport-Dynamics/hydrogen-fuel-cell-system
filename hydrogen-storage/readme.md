# Hydrogen storage [module]

Methods of [hydrogen storage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen_storage) for subsequent use span many approaches including high pressures, cryogenics, and chemical compounds that reversibly release H2 upon heating.

Underground hydrogen storage is useful to provide grid energy storage for intermittent energy sources, like wind power, as well as providing fuel for transportation, particularly for ships and airplanes.

Based on mass, hydrogen has a 3+ times more energy density than gasoline/diesel, however, hydrogen has a high volume so it must be compressed to achieve a great volume/energy ratio.

## 1.1 Compressed hydrogen

Compressed hydrogen costs 2.1% of the energy content [source](https://web.archive.org/web/20080307082839/http://www.iea.org/textbase/nppdf/free/2005/hydrogen2005.pdf)
