## 1.1 Electrolysis

[Electrolysis of water](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrolysis_of_water) is the decomposition of water (H2O) into oxygen (O2) and hydrogen gas (H2) due to an electric current being passed through the water.

Electrolysis efficency can go up to 96% and is about 73% in average for commercial electrolysis products. [source](http://www.electrochemsci.org/papers/vol7/7043314.pdf)

### 1.1.1 Electrocatalyst material

In order to process electrolysis of water, their is a need of:

* **Direct Current**
* **Water**
* **Electrocatalyst** that can be made in (from low effiency to high effiency / low cost to high cost):
  * Stainless steel
  * Carbon(graphite)
  * Carbon(graphite) + platinum
  * C3N4@NG
  

The reaction of theses 3 components in some conditions produce hydrogen and oxygen at a ratio of 2:1.

Note: All component are buyable and relatively cheap except C3N4@NG that is impossible to buy but posses the highest effiency according to [source 1](http://www.synchrotron.org.au/news/publications/lightspeed-newsletter/lightspeed-articles/883-hydrogen-from-water-without-the-precious-metal-price-tag), [source 2](
https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms4783).

C3N4@NG can only be made with a particle accelerator that can only be legally homemade built. [source](https://youtu.be/wjeM2IBhtlc?t=7m53s)

### 1.1.2 Pressure

[High-pressure electrolysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-pressure_electrolysis) is similar to [electrolysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrolysis_of_water) except that hydrogen produced is already compressed in form of liquid so their is no need for a hydrogen compressor.

### 1.1.3 Costs

According to [energy.gov](https://energy.gov/eere/fuelcells/doe-technical-targets-hydrogen-production-electrolysis), hydrogen production costs from electrolysis technologies in 2015 vary from 3.20$/kg to 5.60$/kg.

2.00$/kg to 4.00$/kg are targeted for 2020.
