# PEMFC [module]

[Proton exchange membrane fuel cells](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proton_exchange_membrane_fuel_cell), also known as polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM) fuel cells (PEMFC), are a type of fuel cell being developed for transport applications as well as for stationary fuel cell applications and portable fuel cell applications.
Their distinguishing features include lower temperature/pressure ranges (50 to 100 °C) and a special polymer electrolyte membrane.
PEMFCs operate on a similar principle to their younger sister technology PEM electrolysis.
They are a leading candidate to replace the aging alkaline fuel cell technology, which was used in the Space Shuttle.

## Operation

A fuel cell supplied with hydrogen and oxygen, convert chemical energy into electrical energy.
Therefore a fuel cell continuously supplied with hydrogen and oxygen can generate electricity.
This can be explained under an electrochemical reaction, according to the equation:

`2 H2 + O2 = 2 H2O`

Hydrogen fuel cells are electrochemical cells.
They have two electrodes in contact with a material that can conduct ions, called an electrolyte.
One electrode is the anode and the other is the cathode.
The electrodes in hydrogen fuel cells are relatively stable since they act as catalysts in the release of electrons and are not chemically changed during this process
Therefore, when pure hydrogen is used as the fuel, the only by-products generated from the fuel cell are pure water and heat.
This makes fuel cells potentially very efficient devices with minimal environmental impact.

## Efficiency

The maximal theoretical efficiency applying the [Gibbs free energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gibbs_free_energy) equation ΔG=-237.13 kJ/mol and using the [heating value](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heating_value) of Hydrogen (ΔH=-285.84 kJ/mol) is **83%** at 298 K.

The practical efficiency of a PEM's is in the range of 50–60% . Main factors that create losses are:

* Activation losses
* Ohmic losses
* Mass transport losses
